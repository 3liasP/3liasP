##Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elias, a IT student and developer with expertise in modern technologies. I love creating amazing web applications that are fast, responsive, and user-friendly. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, using languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more. I also have a strong foundation in problem-solving and effective communication, which I developed through my studies and internships.

You can check out some of my projects on my GitHub profile here. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas.

Thanks for visiting my profile and have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
